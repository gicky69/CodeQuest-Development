# CodeQuest-Development
CodeQuest is an application where it teaches the users to learn programming languages, with the help of teaching them step-by-step and challenging them with problemsets.

----- TAKE NOTE ------
This app is still in Development and would require alot of time to finish but this is what we've accomplished for now.

Suggestions:
 - It should contain videos
 - After completing a lesson, or chapters. There should be a quiz, and it's format is either users applying what they've learned and also a multiple choices to help them further understand.
 - It should have a page where users could track their progress.
 - It should have a better designs.
 - Add more problemsets.
 - Improve the IDE Frame into a more user-friendly way.
----------------------

As you can see there are still alot of suggestions, but this is what we've accomplished for now. If you think this is a good application, please help us by giving suggestions/recommendations, or better improve our code.
